So, you’re considering making your own video resume, but aren’t sure where to start. Well, you’ve come to the right place! Prior to founding SeeV.work, I spent the past dozen years working as a producer and creative executive in Hollywood turning real people and their businesses into reality stars with pitch videos called “sizzle tapes.” Ninety-nine percent of the pitches I sold drew upon the same visual and narrative rules, many of which we drew upon when building our video resume product here. I’ve done my best to compile the 4 most important rules for you in the following article.

Video creation is more art than science, but you can be confident that if you follow this definitive guide, you’ll look good, sound professional and likable, and no hiring managers will be injured in the watching of your video resume. Alright, without further ado, here is the Hollywood TV producer’s definitive guide for crafting a killer video resume.

### Rule #1: Look Good

Spoiler alert, the stars of your favorite TV shows, movies, and social media platforms don’t look like that all the time! They put a lot of time and effort (not to mention filters and Photoshopping) into looking that good! And no, I’m not suggesting getting lip fillers, or hiring the team from Queer Eye. However, you should absolutely consider how to craft the most attractive and put together presentation of yourself for your video resume with things like…

Professional Attire: Though selecting the appropriate professional attire for your video resume will depend on the industry and role you’re applying for, whether you’re in finance or tech or auto repair, there are some basic rules that hold true across all industries. Your clothes should be clean and ironed, without stains, wrinkles, or lint, free of distracting patterns, tacky graphics, potentially divisive messages, and likely not overly revealing (applicants to the Spearmint Rhino or Thunder Down Under please disregard). Everyone feels their most confident when they look their best, so bust out that sport coat and pocket square, don your strappiest heels (even though no one will see them) and feel free to accessorize (without going overboard) with the watch and/or jewelry that showcases your style and projects success.

HMU: No, you don’t need a hair and make-up artist standing by for your video resume. However, don’t delude yourself into believing hiring managers aren’t building a first impression based on how you present yourself. Real talk: the better you look in your video resume and at your interview, the more positively you’ll be remembered and the better positions you’ll be considered for. If you’re a guy, get a fresh haircut, and make sure your hair is styled and your beard is trimmed. And ladies, since you’ll be positioned so close to the camera, go lighter and more natural with the make-up and beware the dreaded “flyaway” hairs. Hairspray can be an effective tool against these distracting little buggers, but I’ve seen anti-static dryer sheets work well too.

Final Check: For both men and women, it’s not vain to check the mirror one final time before you start recording to make sure you don’t have any spinach or lipstick on your teeth, rogue hairs, or “bats in the belfry.” Remember, in your video resume, you are the product. This is essential your commercial, baby. Make sure you look your best!

1. Set Yourself Up for Success

Location Scout: The first thing we notice when we go into a new store or restaurant is the layout and cleanliness of the physical location, which immediately shapes our opinion of the business. Would you eat at a restaurant that was dirty, had a bunch of un-bussed tables, and roaches scurrying around the floor? Of course not! So why would you expect someone to hire you when you’re broadcasting from a messy, dimly lit bedroom that looks like an outtake from a hostage ransom video?

When choosing a location to film your video resume, you should choose a spot that’s bright, clean, airy, and professional looking. A nice put-together home office is ideal, but if that’s not in the cards, setting up your mobile phone or webcam on the kitchen counter with the depth of a nice airy living room behind you can look nice too. Avoid boring flat walls and backlighting from windows. And this may be a personal bias, but I’d steer clear of greenscreen filters that put you on a beach in Tahiti or that eerie blurred background thing. This is an opportunity to show you’re proud of who you are (not embarrassed or hiding anything) and that you’re in command of your location.

Quiet on the Set: Regardless where you choose for your filming location, you should make sure the space is quiet, without any background noise.

High-Speed Internet: If you’re planning on filming yourself over an internet video platform like Zoom, make sure you have a high-speed Internet connection so your video doesn’t lag or drop.

Get Horizontal: Unless you are applying for social media manager, or some in-house position at TikTok or Snapchat, I’d recommend filming your video resume with your camera turned horizontally.

Right Angles: A camera positioned too high looking down on the subject looks like a drunk cougar taking a selfie at a bar searching for her most flattering angle, while a camera positioned too low makes you look like your white New Balance wearing dad’s Facebook profile photo (not flattering either). The best camera frame is medium close-up (head and shoulders) and positioned on a desk or counter somewhere around chest height, without too much headroom at the top of the frame.
